story = '''As a boy, willy was lonely and sad. He had no friends, was bullied by billy, and tried to commit suicide. One day a little girl told him that she 
thought he was sad, and that she wanted to help him. Thinking she meant to make fun of him, he pushed her away and created a story in his mind as to why he 
pushed her away. He told himself that she was an ugly alien from Mars. And soon, he began to believe it. When he saw her in the school hallways, he saw an 
alien that was trying to eat students, and in genuine fear for his life, he told teachers what he was seeing. They thought he was crazy, and he was sent to 
a mental institute where he was strapped to a bed in a straight jacket and put in a padded white room. 
No one outside of the facility ever heard from poor willy again.'''
